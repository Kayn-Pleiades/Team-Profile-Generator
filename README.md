## Usage

## Process

### Commit 1: Initial Commit
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: Base Files
Added recommended folders and files. Installed needed packages.

### Commit 3: Init
Added the class js files into the library. Initiated to create json package. Made simple welcome function. 

### Commit 4: Manager Questions
Added the inquirer questions for entering the manager information!

### Commit 5: Employee
Now, using the guildlines from the instructions, I will build the employee class file and its test. The test passes! So next will to be to extend it to the other classes. 

### Commit 6: Manager
I wrote a test for the Manager class, extended the Employee class into the Manager class, and tested that it works. 

### Commit 7: Engineer
I wrote a test for the Engineer class, extended the Employee class into the Engineer class, and tested that it works. Next I will repeat this process for the Intern class. 

### Commit 8: Intern
I wrote a test for the Intern class, extended the Employee class into the Intern class, and tested that it works. Now all my tests pass! Yay!! Funfact, all test examples are based on Hello! Project members. Mitsui Aika, my favorite member, for employee, Takahashi Ai, former leader of Morning Musume, for manager, Sugaya Risako, member of Berryz Koubou (kanji for Kou being that used in engineering), for engineer, and Konemura Kirara, current member of the training program, as intern. Just a fun little easter egg :) Now! To go back to working on index, taking the inputed data for the manager, and turning it into something usable!
